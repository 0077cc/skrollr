Abstract
------

skrollr allows you to animate any css property of any element depending on the horizontal scrollbar.

All you need to do is define keyframes for each element at certain points in --time-- top offset. Each keyframe consists of one or multiple css properties and values.


JavaScript
------

On the JavaScript part there's not much todo. So if you only know CSS and HTMl, perfect.

All there is to do is calling ```skrollr.init([options]);```


HTML
